# task-sourcing
NUS CS2102 Project

Task sourcing is a University project done by 4 computing students. It is a PHP and HTML web application for the submission and bidding of tasks out sourced by the users. The application is designed for a Postgresql database.

To start, load up Postgresql and setup a new database.
In that database run the sql scripts in this order: table_creation.sql -> triggers.sql -> sample_input.sql

After that run the web application from the index.php page at http://localhost/8081/index.php
